                Cornerstone Advisory Partners, Inc., is the fund administrator for IMAF-Cape Fear, LLC.  Administrator fees, based on committed funds and add-on investments, contracted annually, go towards the above administrative infrastructure/fund executive services.

            </p>
                <span>Add-on Investments</span>
                <br>
                Add-on investments are opportunities for members to individually invest an additional amount of their own money alongside the Fund in portfolio companies that are of particular interest to individual members. For example, Company X may indicate that it is interested in a total investment from IMAF-Cape Fear, LLC of $500,000. The Fund may decide to invest $250,000 in the current round in Company X. That would leave an investment of up to $250,000 that could be available for members to invest in the current round on a pro rata basis of units held. In the event that certain members do not elect to take their pro rata portion of available add-ons, other members would have the opportunity to take more than their pro rata portion.
